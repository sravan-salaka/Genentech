# Genentech
## Hadoop Proof of Concept
### 1. Introduction
In this Github repository titled "Genentech", I document my findings from the evaluation and testing of various Hadoop tools from a SPA perspective. The repository contains the following: <br />

1. **Proposed Hadoop Ecosystem for Biometrics Statistical Programming Team** - In this document I evaluate and test the existing pilot implementation of the Hadoop Ecosystem.<br />
2. **An R executable (Windows) for batch conversion of SAS files to CSV**<br />
3. **Documentation of the R executable** - Documentation for using the R executable.<br />
4. **The Final Documentation** - I address the most pressing business problems pertaining to Hadoop, Clinical Trial Data and Teradata.<br />

### 2. Links for Suggested Reading
When I started work on the Hadoop Proof of concept, I lacked a compact understanding of how the tools within a Hadoop Ecosystem worked and how they could be configured to suit one's needs. Here, I enclose a list of references that helped me get a stronger understanding of how Hadoop and it's components work. I would **strongly** suggest that you go through these articles as they will not only help you get an understanding of Hadoop but also get you in touch with a wider community of Hadoop users.
