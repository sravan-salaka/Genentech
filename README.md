### 1. Introduction
In this Github repository titled "Genentech", I document my findings from the evaluation and testing of various Hadoop tools from a SPA perspective. The repository contains the following: <br />
1. **Proposed Hadoop Ecosystem for Biometrics Statistical Programming Team** - In this document I evaluate and test the existing pilot implementation of the Hadoop Ecosystem.<br />
2. **An R executable (Windows) for batch conversion of SAS files to CSV**<br />
3. **Documentation of the R executable** - Documentation for using the R executable.<br />
4. **The Final Documentation** - I address the most pressing business problems pertaining to Hadoop, Clinical Trial Data and Teradata.<br />
